psHUD
=====

A powershell HUD at the tip of your fingers
___

My inspiration for psHUD was [Visor for Mac](http://visor.binaryage.com/). At any time press `CTRL` + `~` and a semi-transparent powershell termial will appear at the top of your screen. Press the hotkey again to hide it.

Right now psHUD is very alpha. I have been using it myself for a year now, and it is pretty darn stable. The biggest problem is that you can't configure the hotkey, or change the transparency. That will come soon enough though.

Enjoy, and feel free to fork. Patches gladly accepted.

Oh, one last thing....because this started off as a personal tool, there is a need for refactoring. I will be doing this as I go, so don't get your panties in a bunch over it.
